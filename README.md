# Movie-Recommendation-System

#### In this experiment I have implemented a movies recommendation system using machine lerarning.

## Problem Statement :

  The problem statement is something like the user should gives any movies name and they will get a list of movies name based on their choice.
  
## Recommendation System:
    
   Recommendation system can be categorized into 3 parts :
    
    1. Content Based Recommendation System : Based on the content of the movies it groups the similar movies .
    
    2. Popularity Based Recommendation System : Based on the popularity of the movies or the reviews of the users it groups the similar movies .
    
    3. Collaborative Based Recommendation System : Tt groups the similar movies based on the watching pattern of the users.
